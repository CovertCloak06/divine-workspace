Technical spike for: $ARGUMENTS

## Goal: Learn and explore, not ship

### Step 1: Define the Question
What are we trying to figure out?
- Is this approach feasible?
- How does this library work?
- What's the performance like?

### Step 2: Timebox
Set a limit: 2-4 hours max.
If you can't answer by then, the answer might be "it's too complex."

### Step 3: Explore
Build throwaway code to answer the question:
- Don't worry about quality
- Don't write tests
- Try multiple approaches if needed

### Step 4: Evaluate
- Did it work?
- What did we learn?
- What are the gotchas?

### Step 5: Document
Write up findings:
- What we tried
- What worked/didn't
- Recommendation for real implementation

### Step 6: Clean Up
Delete spike code or clearly mark it.
**Don't let spike code become production code.**
