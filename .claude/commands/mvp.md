## Goal: Simplest version that delivers value

### Step 1: Define MVP
Use the **product-architect** agent to:

### Step 2: Plan

- Simplest possible implementation
- Cut all nice-to-haves
- Note shortcuts taken

### Step 3: Build Fast
Implement with:

- TODO comments for later
- Basic error handling

### Step 4: Basic Tests
Use the **test-writer** agent for:
- Happy path only
