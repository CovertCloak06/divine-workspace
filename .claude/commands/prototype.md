Build prototype of: $ARGUMENTS

## Goal: Something to show/test, not to ship

### Step 1: Define Scope
Use the **product-architect** agent to:
- What are we demonstrating?
- Who is the audience?
- What feedback do we want?

### Step 2: Plan
Use the **architect** agent to:
- Minimal structure
- Mock what you can
- Fake data is fine

### Step 3: Build
Focus on:
- What people will see/interact with
- Skip backend if possible
- Hardcode where it saves time

### Step 4: Test with Users
Get feedback on:
- Does it make sense?
- Is it useful?
- What's missing?

### Step 5: Decision
Based on feedback:
- Build for real → `/project:feature`
- Iterate prototype
- Abandon idea

### Step 6: Next Steps
Don't ship prototype.
Plan proper implementation if moving forward.
