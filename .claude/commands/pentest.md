Think like an attacker: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Reconnaissance
What can an attacker learn?
- Public endpoints
- Error messages
- API responses
- Client-side code

## Step 2: Injection Points
Use the **security-auditor** agent to find:
- User inputs
- File uploads
- API parameters
- Headers

## Step 3: Authentication Testing
- Can auth be bypassed?
- Session management issues?
- Password handling?
- Token security?

## Step 4: Authorization Testing
- Can users access others' data?
- Can roles be escalated?
- Are all endpoints protected?

## Step 5: Data Exposure
- What's in API responses?
- Client-side storage?
- Logs and errors?

## Step 6: Report
Document findings with:
- Vulnerability description
- How to exploit
- Impact assessment
- Fix recommendation
