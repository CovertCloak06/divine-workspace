# Frostline — Text Art Library

Curated text art for one Whiteout Survival alliance. Tap, copy, paste into chat.

## Local preview

This app runs **in this preview** without any backend — it falls back to `localStorage` when neither Netlify Functions nor Cloudflare Pages Functions are reachable. The dev fallback password is `0022`.

To open the live preview, just view `index.html`.

## Deploy options

The client auto-detects whichever backend is live: it probes `/.netlify/functions/get-art` first, falls back to `/api/get-art` (Cloudflare Pages Functions). So either deploy path works without code changes.

### A. Cloudflare Pages + Workers + KV (recommended — generous free tier)

1. **Install Wrangler** locally if you don't have it: `npm i -g wrangler`
2. **Authenticate**: `npx wrangler login`
3. **Create the KV namespace** (one-time):
   ```sh
   npx wrangler kv namespace create FROSTLINE_KV
   ```
   Note the `id` it prints, paste it into `wrangler.toml` under `[[kv_namespaces]]`.
4. **Create the Pages project** (one-time, via dashboard or CLI):
   ```sh
   npx wrangler pages project create frostline-art --production-branch main
   ```
5. **Set the editor password** in the Cloudflare dashboard:
   *Pages → frostline-art → Settings → Environment variables → Production*
   - `EDITOR_PASSWORD` = your chosen password
   *Then bind the KV namespace*:
   - Settings → Functions → KV namespace bindings → Variable name `FROSTLINE_KV` → select the namespace
6. **Deploy**:
   ```sh
   cd apps/text-art-library
   npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name=frostline-art
   ```

### B. Netlify Functions + Blobs

1. **Install function dependencies** once:
   ```sh
   cd apps/text-art-library
   npm install
   ```
2. **Set the editor password** in the Netlify dashboard:
   *Site config → Environment variables → Functions scope*
   - `EDITOR_PASSWORD` = your chosen password
3. **Deploy from the CLI**:
   ```sh
   npx netlify-cli@latest deploy --prod --dir . --functions ./netlify/functions --no-build
   ```

## Bug feedback pipeline

There's an in-app feedback form in the Settings drawer (Send Feedback section) that anyone using the site can submit. Each submission flows through `netlify/functions/submit-bug.js`, which does four things in order — all of them optional and skipped silently if their env var is missing:

1. **AI triage** via Anthropic's API (model `claude-haiku-4-5`). Reads the report, returns severity / area / summary / likely-cause / suggested-fix area as JSON. Costs pennies per report.
2. **GitHub Issue** created in `CovertCloak06/divine-workspace` with the triage analysis pre-filled in the body, labeled `bug` + `triage:<sev>`.
3. **Discord push** to your phone via the Discord mobile app (a webhook URL = a push notification).
4. **Storage** in Netlify Blobs (`frostline-feedback` store) under `bug/<id>.json` for the full report + everything that happened.

To enable any of the four, add these env vars in *Netlify Site config → Environment variables*:

| Variable | What it enables | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | AI triage on every report | https://console.anthropic.com/ |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Push notifications to your phone | Discord server → Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Tracking issue creation | https://github.com/settings/tokens (classic, `repo` scope) |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Target repo for issues | Just `CovertCloak06/divine-workspace` |

(`.env.example` also lists these — add them to your local `.env` for `netlify dev`.)

### Auto-fix loop (optional but slick)

If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, every bug report becomes a tracking Issue. From there, you can add the `auto-fix` label to any issue and a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/claude-auto-fix.yml`) spawns a Claude Code session that reads the issue, makes a surgical fix, and opens a draft PR.

To enable the auto-fix loop:

1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to *GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions* (same key as above).
2. Install the GitHub App referenced by the action (run `claude /install-github-app` once if you haven't, or follow the action's setup docs).
3. That's it. Add the `auto-fix` label to a triaged issue and watch the PR appear.

You stay in the loop: the PRs are draft, so nothing merges without you reviewing on your phone.

You can ship with either or both backends in the folder — the client picks whichever responds.

## How the data layer works

- **`art.js`** is the bundled source of truth. Always committed.
- **Backend store** holds runtime state under these keys:
  - `art` — user-created pieces added through the editor
  - `deletedIds` — IDs of bundled pieces the editor removed
  - `flag/<id>` — per-piece flag note (one key per flagged piece)
  - Netlify uses Blobs, Cloudflare uses KV — same semantics.
- On load, the client merges: bundle → filter by deletedIds → overlay `wosVerified` from store → append user-created.
- When you've accumulated user-created pieces, the editor can hit **⬇ Download updated art.js**, commit that, then clear the store (or just leave it — still valid).

## Editor mode

- There is no lock button anywhere in the chrome.
- Tap the **snowflake icon** in the header **7 times within 3 seconds** to open the auth modal.
- Editor mode lasts until the tab is closed or refreshed.

## WoS rules (cheat-sheet)

Whiteout Survival chat renders in a proportional font, so raw character counts
are meaningless. The width model (editor meter + informational audit notes):
**visual columns**, where narrow chars (`. , : ; ' | ! i l`) count 0.5, wide
chars (`M W @ # % &`) count 1.5, and everything else counts 1.0. Soft note
past **30**, strong note past **34** (the line wraps in the game bubble).

**Publishing is UNGATED (wos112).** There is no character whitelist, no
submission blocking, and no "test in game" messaging anywhere — the earlier
heuristic gate wrongly rejected art that works in game. The gallery is
governed by curation and the 🚩 bug-report flow: art in the gallery is
ready-to-go by definition, and anything that misbehaves in game gets reported
and fixed/removed by the admin.

Invisible save-path normalization (client and server): NFC, spaces → NBSP,
trailing blank rows trimmed.

The lightbox preview is a true game view: a fixed 17.5em bubble that wraps
over-wide lines at glyph level exactly like the game — art is never shrunk to
"fit" anymore.

Safe character families:
- Pure emoji rows
- Block + box-drawing (`█ ▓ ▒ ░ ─ │ ┌ ┐ └ ┘ ╔ ╗ ╚ ╝ ═ ║`)
- Fullwidth chars where empty cells use `　` (U+3000)

Avoid ASCII `/ \ - | # * +` for shape-building — they're proportional and will
drift. Avoid Hangul/Tibetan/IPA/modifier-letter kaomoji — the game font lacks
them (they render blank/tofu in chat even though desktops show them fine).
